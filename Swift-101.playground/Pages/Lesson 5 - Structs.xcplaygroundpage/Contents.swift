// Value types, as explained in lesson 4, are copied and passed along to whatever consumes them.
// Once again the classroom analogy:
//      A reference type is like the white board - anyone getting information from the white board refers to the same instance.  Change it and it changes for everyone.
//      A value type is like the worksheets passed out to students - each one gets a copy that they can all write on, draw on, feed to their dog and claim it got lost and it does not affect any other students worksheet.

// A Struct is a value type.  It is, like a Class, a basic means of modeling things.  It to can "have things" and "do things" ie. have state and function.
